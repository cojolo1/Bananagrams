This is a digital version of the modern boardgame _Bananagrams_!

Goal of The Game:
Be the first to finish your board.

How to Play:
1. With your initial 15 tiles begin by building a grid of letters where any adjacent tiles must spell a valid
   word either from right to left or from top to bottom.
    - Click anywhere on your and type the word you want to place, and hit enter. If the tiles are in your hand, the word will appear on your board.
    - By default, the program will place letters from left to right, if you would like to place letters from top to bottom, press the down arrow
      before pressing enter.
    - Once a tile has been placed, you can move it around on you board by first clicking it, then clicking the tile you would like to move it to.
3. Once you have no more tiles in your hand, press 1 to "Peel!" and another will be dealt to you for you to play. When you "Peel!"
   the opponent will also be dealt a tile. If the opponent "Peel!"s, you will be dealt a tile too.
4. If a tile in your hand is giving you trouble, click it, then press 2 to "Dump!". This will place the tile back in the main pile and deal you three
   tiles back.
5. Once you have no more tiles in your hand and there is less than 2 tiles remaining in the main pile, press the space bar to call "Bananagrams!" and
   end the game.
