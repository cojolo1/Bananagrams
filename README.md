Goal of The Game:
Be the first to call "Bananagrams!".

How to Play:
1. With your initial 15 tiles begin by building a grid of letters where any adjacent tiles must spell a valid word.
   This can either be from left to right or from top to bottom. Look at the boards above for an example.
    - To place a word, click where you would like the word to start,  type the word, then hit enter. If the tiles are in your hand, the word will appear on your board.
    - By default, the program will place letters from left to right. If you would like to place letters from top to bottom, press the down arrow
      before pressing enter.
    - Once a tile has been placed, you can move it around on your board by first clicking it, and then clicking the tile you would like to move it to.
3. Once you have no more tiles in your hand, press 1 to "Peel!", and another tile will be dealt to you. When you "Peel!"
   the opponent will also be dealt a tile. If the opponent "Peel!"s, you will be dealt a tile as well.
4. If a tile in your hand is giving you trouble, click it, then press 2 to "Dump!". This will place the tile back in the main pile and deal three tiles back to you.
5. Once you have no more tiles in your hand and there are less than 2 tiles remaining in the main pile, press the space bar to call "Bananagrams!" and
   end the game. If the AI opponent calls "Bananagrams!" before you, then you lose.
